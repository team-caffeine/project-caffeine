## Project Description
Deja Brew is an interactive, engaging app designed to teach you how to make different espresso-based coffee drinks. Sign in, choose an avatar, and you will be directed to our Study page. Learn what goes into these nine different drinks, and then move on to our Practice page where you can start adding ingredients and making those drinks! When you feel prepared to work under pressure, our Play page will generate an order for you that you have to complete in under a minute! 

This app was built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
